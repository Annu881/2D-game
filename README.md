## 🎮 About The Game

In **Neon Shift**, you control a gravity-defying agent navigating through hazardous neon-lit corridors. The catch? You can't just jump over obstacles—you have to flip the entire world's gravity to survive. 

Master momentum, avoid deadly lasers and spikes, and collect data cores (coins) to progress.

## ✨ Features

*   **Gravity Flipping Mechanic**: Seamlessly switch gravity up and down (`Tab` or `Shift`) to walk on ceilings and floor.
*   **Momentum-Based Physics**: Smooth movement that requires precision and timing.
*   **Neon Aesthetics**: A clean, modern sci-fi look with glowing visuals.
*   **Challenging Hazards**: Spikes, pits, and tricky platform placements.
*   **Godot 4 Powered**: Built using the latest stable version of the Godot Engine.
